Beat detection and cut to music video creator (python based, music beat detection and video cut/join libraries) - finds all the  beats that a music file has and cuts various videos and joins alongside the audio track to make a compilation video

## Libraries to be used

- ffmpeg (python wrapper - for audio / video processing) [FFMPEG webpage](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

## Setup 
- Install latest anaconda distribution on a linux machine
- Find an mp3 file (preferable EDM as it is more synthetic, precise and clear)
- Using librosa, find the times where beat occurs
- Process (input) a set of video files

- Merge videos (removing their audios) into a single video
